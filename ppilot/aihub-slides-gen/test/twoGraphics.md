# Even More Fun With DDF
Martin Packer ðŸ¦• , IBM

### Abstract

* The idea of "alien" DB2 work coming into your system through DDF strikes fear into even the most seasoned Performance Specialist...

* How will I classify it?

* What will stop it from taking over my machine?

* This presentation describes how to use performance data to address both of those questions, based on the author's recent experiences with numerous customers.

* It also enables you to understand what applications and machines are issuing the DDF requests, improving your knowledge of the application landscape.

* This presentation has substantially evolved in 2017.
