Team Building Activities
Number Puzzle
This game requires some props, including number and letter cards. Participants need to combine the number and letter cards to form a word or phrase. However, they can only use each number or letter on the cards once. This game can help team members improve their thinking and problem-solving skills.

Objective: Test Communication Skills
Time: 10-20 minutes

Materials: Pen and paper

Instructions:

The leader prepares several sheets of paper with circles drawn on them. It's best to have multiple sheets.
Pair up participants for the competition.
Before starting, each pair sits back-to-back.
Within the designated time, one person describes the circle while the other draws it. The drawer can only listen and cannot ask questions or let the describer see their drawing.
When time is up, see who drew the circle the fastest and most accurately.
Roles can be swapped for another round.
Notes:

This game reveals different communication issues among participants.
The leader can explain the art and importance of communication after the game.
Objective: Break the Ice
Materials: Newspaper or scrap paper (rolled into balls)

Instructions:

Divide the group into two teams and establish territories for each team, marking a no-man's land between them.
When the leader gives the signal, the battle begins. Within the designated time (about 3 minutes), team members can use any method to throw the "scrap balls" into the opposing team's territory, but they cannot stand in the no-man's land while throwing.
The team with the fewest "scrap balls" in their territory at the end wins. Balls in the no-man's land do not count.
Objective: Recreational Game to Increase Fun Atmosphere and Highlight Non-Verbal Communication Limitations
Time: 20-30 minutes

Materials: Slips of paper

Instructions:

Select 5-6 people to play "Pass the Expression," while the others watch.
The participants line up facing forward, either sitting or standing, but they cannot turn around.
The host gives a slip of paper with an expression like "boiling with rage" or "full of charm" to the last person in line. They then convey the expression to the next person using any method except speaking.
The expression is passed along to the front of the line, and the host shows the answer sheet to the first person to see if they can guess the correct expression.
After one or two rounds, select another group from the audience to continue the game.
Notes:

Everyone should have a chance to be both an observer and a participant, as the process of passing expressions often makes the observers laugh.
It's best to choose a lively and playful participant to start the expression passing.
